              streaming platform online that has absolutely no ads or any kind
              of redirection to other malicious websites. We provide animes in

              No, you don't need to create any account in order to watch anime.
              You can just come on our streaming site and watch with ease

              So there are like thousands of anime streaming sites, but mostly
              all of them, to be precise 98% of them have ads. Some of them are
              too dangerous... They redirect you to some sites that can steal
              your data. So we decided to make a ultra user friendly site
              without a single ad. But having no ads doesn't make a site best
              isn't? So, how about these features:

                <strong>Video Experience: </strong> Our video player is made by
                us, we don't rely on third party Iframes. With that we can
                easily customize our video player how ever we want & we took
                feedback from lots of people, after that we created it. It
                turned out to be awesome.
                <br></br>

                We have features that let you adjust your quality settings as
                you please. With our high-quality videos, you can stream your
                favorite anime even in 1080p. It doesn't matter how slow or fast
                your internet is, we try to make sure you don't find any
                buffering or interruption while streaming.
